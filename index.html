                    <strong>Lamu Palace Hotel</strong> is set in an elegant, historic building on the beautiful shores of the Indian Ocean. After its extensive refurbishment the hotel brings modern comforts and amenities, while retaining much of the building&rsquo;s original charm. Spend your days relaxing on the beach or by the swimming pool, or exploring the historic architecture, restaurants and shops of Lamu Island, The hotel offers excellent dining options for all with a choice of restaurants ranging from gourmet to pizza. There&rsquo;s also a private beach, Families have plenty of activities and amenities to choose from. Located off the coast of northern Kenya, Lamu Island is one of the main islands of the Lamu Archipelago. With a trade history that dates back to the 14th century and an abundance of fantastically preserved Swahili and Islamic architecture, it is a major destination for anyone with interest in East Africa&rsquo;s colorful heritage. There are no paved roads on Lamu Island, and pedestrians and donkey carts still ply its sandy alleyways as they have been for hundreds of years. Consequently, a visit there can feel like stepping back in time. Visitors come to disconnect from technology and to revel in the beauty of the island&rsquo;s white-sand beaches and the azure Indian Ocean views.&nbsp;Lamu Island has been continuously inhabited for over 700 years since Arab traders established a port there in the 14th century. In the centuries that followed, it became a major seaport for trade between the native Africans of the Swahili Coast and visiting Arabs, Persians, Indians, and Europeans. Lamu Old Town grew prosperous during the slave trade years, and for a brief period, was governed by the Sultan of Zanzibar, the one-time Omani ruler of Tanzania&rsquo;s Zanzibar Archipelago.&nbsp;After Kenyan independence in 1963, Lamu&rsquo;s reputation as a tourist destination grew gradually before being cemented in 2001 with the inscription of Lamu Old Town as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Today, the town is recognized as the oldest and best-preserved Swahili settlement in all of East Africa.&nbsp;To some extent the archipelago is an anachronism: there are still almost no motor vehicles, and life moves at the pace of a donkey or a dhow. Lamu island, itself, however, has seen drastic changes. Because of its special status in the Islamic world as a much-respected centre of <strong>religious teaching</strong>, Saudi aid has poured in: the hospital, schools and religious centres are all supported by it. In recent times too, the tourist economy, and consequent investment, has boomed. The island has outgrown its roots as a 1970s budget travellers&rsquo; paradise to become something entirely more <strong>commercial</strong>: by the early 2000s guesthouses and boutique hotels were thick on the ground in both Lamu town and Shela, along with satellite dishes, cybercaf&eacute;s and souvenir shops. Today, islanders are concerned about the future. Western travel advisories have hit the <strong>tourism industry</strong> hard over the past few years, with a number of hotels and restaurants forced to close, or at least go into hibernation. A massive new <strong>port</strong> is planned, which might provide some jobs, although it will wreak havoc on the livelihoods of Lamu&rsquo;s small fishermen and contribute to the destruction of the islands&rsquo; historic character. The damage that would be done goes further than spoiling the tranquillity. The Lamu archipelago is one of the most important sources for knowledge about pre-colonial Africa. <strong>Archeological sites</strong> indicate that towns have existed on these islands for at least 1200 years. The dunes behind Lamu beach, for example, are said to conceal the remains of long-deserted settlements. And somewhere close by on the mainland, perhaps just over the border in Somalia, archeologists expect one day to uncover the ruins of Shungwaya, the town that the nine tribes that comprise the Mijikenda people claim as their ancestral home. For now, however, <strong>Lamu island</strong>, most people&rsquo;s single destination, still has plenty to recommend it. Here you will find the archipelago&rsquo;s best beach and its two main towns, Lamu and Shela. Manda island, directly opposite, is little visited except as Lamu&rsquo;s gateway to the outside world (the airstrip), though its own beach is beautiful and there are a few delightful places to stay. <a href="https://www.roughguides.com/kenya/coast/lamu-archipelago/#pate-island"><strong>Pate island</strong>,</a> accessible by dhow or motorboat, but completely off the tourism radar, makes a fascinating excursion if you have a week or more in the area.

As Shela continues to emerge as a curated tourist destination, Lamu old town remains unperturbed from the risk of gentrification as most of the buildings date back to the 17th century. Here, local Lamu residents will shower you with the best of Swahili hospitality as the beauty of the local architecture astounds you.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s best to roam around the old town with a tour guide. Remember to keep a look out for the famous Lamu port and the Lamu National Museum.&nbsp;

                                    Just two or three hours by ferry from Lamu, totally unaffected by tourism and rarely visited, Pate island has some of the most impressive ruins anywhere on the coast and a clutch of old Swahili settlements which, at different times, have been as important as Lamu or more so. There are few places on the coast as memorable. Pate is mostly low-lying and almost surrounded by mangrove swamps; no two maps of it ever agree &ndash; ours shows only the permanent dry land, not the ever-changing mangrove forests that surround it &ndash; so getting on and off the island requires deft awareness of the tides. Its remoteness, coupled with limited transport, deters travellers. In truth, though, Pate is not a difficult destination, and is an easier island to physically walk around than Lamu, with none of that island&rsquo;s exhausting soft sand.

                                    Practically within shouting distance of Lamu town, Manda Island &ndash; with next to no fresh water &ndash; was only recently almost uninhabited but is now the site of several new luxury homes and a couple of boutique resorts. Aside from the allure of the pristine beach, it is also the site of the main airstrip on the islands, and the location of the old ruined town of Takwa (favourite destination of the dhow-trip operators). Significant archeologically for the ruins of Takwa and Manda, the north side of the island is also the location of the fabulous Manda Bay lodge.

                                        Lamu has one of Kenyaâ€™s most attractive coral reefs. Daily excursions are organized around the relaxed waters off the Ras Kitau bay and the Takwa mangrove creek. This full-day activity promises the spotting of marine life such as exotic fish, sea turtles and dolphins. On a lucky afternoon, you may just be able to spot the gigantic whale shark. As you rest of from diving in the deep sea, you can spend the rest of the afternoon cooling off with other watersports like water skiing and kitesurfing at the Majlis Resort.
